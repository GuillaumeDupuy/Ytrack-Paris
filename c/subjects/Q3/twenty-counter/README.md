# Instructions

Create a filename `twenty-counter.c` and write a function `twentyCounter()` that prints all the numbers from 1 to 20 separated with a space and a newline ('\n') at the end.

> ⚠️ for loop MUST be used for this exercise ! You are not allowed to simply print out all the numbers one after the other manually

# Expected Functions

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int twentyCounter() {
    // your code here
}
```

# Usage

Here is a possible `main.c` file to test your function :

```C
#include "twenty-counter.c"

int main()
{
    twentyCounter();
}
```

And its output :

```
$ gcc main.c && ./a.out
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
$
```
