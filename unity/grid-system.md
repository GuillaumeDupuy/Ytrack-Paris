# 🎮Game

Based on grid-system the game will be a reference to “Sokoban”.

We suggest to check the game if you don’t know the game.

To resume, it is a puzzle game you will have cubes and differents places to put them and each places need to be fill with cubes.

You can move the cubes with your player running around just by pushing them toward a direction.

Obviously the difficulty increase with the level and traps, walls, etc..

# 3C

# 📹Camera

The camera doesn’t need to move, it has to be fix on the platform as long as it can see the player and the cubes.

# ⌨️Controls

The player can move around the platform with:

- Z front
- S back
- Q left
- D right

The player can pause the game with “P”.

# 👾Character

The character can move around the level and push the cubes toward a direction

# 📝Functionalities

Create a script which create a grid with walls, a ground where the player can move and atleast 2 cubes and 2 places corresponding of the number of cubes when the game begins.

A button undo for the player if he wants to undo his movements.

The cube move on the opposite when the player hit it.

The game ends when all the cubes are place on the corresponding area.

When we win the game, a menu appear and shows a button "Restart", "Menu", and "Quit".

We also want a pause menu with “Resume”, “Restart” and “Quit”.

Create 2 differents scenes one for the game, and one for the menu at the launch of the game.

The player is animate with idle, run. (You can take whatever assets you want) 

# 🔥Bonus

Prevent cubes from getting in the same place and not getting through the walls.

Prevent cubes from not moving when they are in their corresponding area.

Make a better script which create the level procedurally.

Add in the level create walls for disturb the moves.

Create a timer to show at the end, the time elapsed for complete the level.

Connect and use a database for the seeding.

Make an UI for enter the seed and replay the level for a better score.
