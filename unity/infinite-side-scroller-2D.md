# 🎮Game

The game will be an infinite game, we will need a character which correspond to the player.

The player will only have one control the jump to go through the different platforms.

Concerning the game itself, platforms will approach with different heights and same spaces.

The goal is just to perform as best as we can.

# 3C

# 📹Camera

The camera doesn’t need to move, it has to be fix on the platform as long as it can see the player and the platforms approaching.

# ⌨️Controls

There is only one control JUMP on any key.

# 👾Character

Character can jump to not fall by colliding with platforms, otherwise it will die

# 📝Functionalities

Platforms must spawn procedurally(only height need to change) , and need to go forward in the direction of the player

The player can jump only if on a platform.

Platforms must be destroy when it got out of the camera

We also want a menu with “Play” and “Quit”, and UI for display the score which increment each time with pass a platform

The player(sprite) is animate with idle, run, jump. (You can take whatever assets you want, we recommend to take a 2D sprites) [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=2d%2Fcharacters&price=0-0&orderBy=1) you can find some free assets.

# 🔥Bonus

We want 2 scenes, on one hand the menu, on the other hand the game.

Implement a collectible system with a coin which increase the score.

The paltforms has different size but the space between are still the same.

Pause system is implement, and a save system.

Implement a double jump for the player.

For increase the difficulty the platform must go faster and faster.

If you desire, you can do another infinite scroller but it need atleast only one control, and a procedural generation.
