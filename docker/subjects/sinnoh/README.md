# Sinnoh ðŸ’Ž

Immerse yourself in the world of PokÃ©mon for a few minutes! This exercise will be more of a project showcase than a real exercise, which means there will be no help. There is just a single documentation you will need to use.

# Instructions

- Create a Dockerfile in a directory somewhere.
- Clone [this repository](https://github.com/Deytron/sinnoh-repo) _(or download the archive)_ which contains a Node project, and extract everything so that you have the Dockerfile and the `package.json` files at the same place.
- [Per this documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/), build and run the project. Once done, head to `localhost:8080`.
- Put the password you got from the exercise in `sinnoh.sh`

> Feel free to edit the content of the project

# Expected result

You should be greeted by Professor Rowan when heading to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
